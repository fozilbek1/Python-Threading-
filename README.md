# Python-Threading-
This Python threading tutorial provides a beginner-friendly introduction to threading, a concept in Python that allows for concurrent execution of multiple tasks. Threads are described as separate flows of execution, with the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensuring only one thread controls the Python interpreter at a time, facilitating thread safety.

The tutorial explains the distinction between CPU-bound tasks, which wait for internal events, and IO-bound tasks, which wait for external events like user input. It recommends using multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks and threading for IO-bound tasks to optimize performance.

Practical examples are presented to illustrate threading usage, such as eating breakfast, drinking coffee, and studying. Each task is executed concurrently in separate threads, demonstrating the benefits of multithreading in Python programs.

This tutorial is suitable for beginners as it offers clear explanations and simple examples to help them grasp threading concepts effectively. It serves as a valuable resource for beginners seeking to understand and implement threading in their Python projects.
